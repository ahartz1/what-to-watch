# What to Watch: Movie Recommendations

#### System Requirements

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* You will need to download the [MovieLens 100k](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip) dataset. Unzip the downloaded file and move the files `u.item`, `u.user`, and `u.data` to the location where you intend to save the `movie_lib.py` file.

* **To run this program**, save `movie_lib.py` to your computer. Using a command-line program (such as Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file and run the following line: **`python3 movie_lib.py`**

### User-Specific
* **Recommended.** This mode will show you recommendations specific to your tastes by analyzing what others who have similar preferences have rated highly. The movies that you have already seen are filtered out. There is a menu system that allows you to select the number of results and the minimum number of overlapping movie ratings with other users from which to make the recommendations.
* **Popular.** This mode will help you find popular movies you haven't seen.

### Pure Popular Movies
This mode lets you explore movies based on user ratings. There is a menu system to allow you to specify the number of results and the minimum number of user ratings.
